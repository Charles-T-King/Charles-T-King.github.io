  <h3>About the fund</h3>
  <p>
    The Student Loan Fund was established over eighty years ago to help Millburn Township students further their
    educational goals. Renamed in 1974 to honor Dr. Charles T. King, who retired as Superintendent of schools after 27
    years of service in the system, the Fund is sponsored by the Millburn Township Conference of Parents and Teachers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to the tremendous increase in college tuition, the Fund plays an important role in helping to finance
    students’
    postsecondary school educations. The loans are need-based and currently interest free. More than 700 students
    have received them to date.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Fund is maintained by personal and business contributions from within the community. Through the generosity
    of our residents and businesses, over $2.5 million in loans have been made to students throughout the years. The
    loans are due upon graduation and by “paying it forward” the fund is continually replenished by past recipients to
    support students in the future.

  <p>
    The Charles T. King Student Loan Fund, Inc. is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
