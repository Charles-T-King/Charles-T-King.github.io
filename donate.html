  <h3>Donate to the fund</h3>
  <p>
    The Fund is maintained by personal and business contributions from within the community. Through the generosity
    of our residents and businesses, over $2.5 million in loans have been made to students throughout the years. The
    loans are due upon graduation and by “paying it forward” the fund is continually replenished by past recipients to
    support students in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, because loans are currently offered interest free, students repaying their existing loans means that
    the size of the fund remains constant. With college tuition continuing to increase drastically, a larger fund
    is required to keep pace. Your donation will augment the size of the fund and make it possible for more
    students to receive loans.
