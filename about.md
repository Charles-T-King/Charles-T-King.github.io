The Student Loan Fund was established over eighty years ago to help Millburn Township students further their
educational goals. Renamed in 1974 to honor Dr. Charles T. King, who retired as Superintendent of schools after 27
years of service in the system, the Fund is sponsored by the Millburn Township Conference of Parents and Teachers and
is maintained by personal and business contributions from within the community.

Charles T. King is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, which is run and maintained
by volunteers.

This website is built and maintained by current and former Millburn High School students, including:

* Ruslan Volyar
* Abhinav Madahar
* Asena Yildiz
* Vikrant Misra
