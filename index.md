# The Charles T. King Student Loan Fund
The Student Loan Fund was established over eighty years ago to help Millburn Township students further their
educational goals. Renamed in 1974 to honor Dr. Charles T. King, who retired as Superintendent of schools after 27
years of service in the system, the Fund is sponsored by the Millburn Township Conference of Parents and Teachers.

Due to the tremendous increase in college tuition, the Fund plays an important role in helping to finance students’
postsecondary school educations. The loans are need-based and currently interest free. More than 700 students
have received them to date.

The Fund is maintained by personal and business contributions from within the community. Through the generosity
of our residents and businesses, over $2.5 million in loans have been made to students throughout the years. The
loans are due upon graduation and by “paying it forward” the fund is continually replenished by past recipients to
support students in the future.

The Charles T. King Student Loan Fund, Inc. is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
